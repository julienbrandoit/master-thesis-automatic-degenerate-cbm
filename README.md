# Master Thesis â€“ Automatic Generation of Degenerate Conductance-Based Neuron Models

Deep learning pipeline for generating degenerate conductance-based neuron models from spike times using Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs). This repository contains the codebase developed as part of my master's thesis in biomedical engineering.

## ðŸ§  Motivation

Understanding how the brain maintains stable function through diverse biophysical configurations â€” neuronal degeneracy â€” is a central challenge in neuroscience. Experimentalists often lack tools to relate recorded spike trains to the full set of plausible underlying conductance-based models (CBMs).

This work introduces a solution that bridges that gap using a novel deep learning architecture and the theory of Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs) to map spike time data to multiple valid neuronal parameter configurations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

1. Create a pipeline to generate degenerate populations of CBMs that reproduce specific neuronal activities.

2. Enable experimental neuroscientists to generate models without deep expertise in machine learning or numerical modeling.

3. Provide a user-friendly open-source software interface to make CBM analysis accessible and practical in lab settings.

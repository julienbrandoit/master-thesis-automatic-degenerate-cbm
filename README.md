# Master Thesis â€“ Automatic Generation of Degenerate Conductance-Based Neuron Models

Deep learning pipeline for generating degenerate conductance-based neuron models from spike times using Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs). This repository contains the codebase developed as part of my master's thesis in biomedical engineering.

## ðŸ§  Motivation

Understanding how the brain maintains stable function through diverse biophysical configurations â€” neuronal degeneracy â€” is a central challenge in neuroscience. Experimentalists often lack tools to relate recorded spike trains to the full set of plausible underlying conductance-based models (CBMs).

This work introduces a solution that bridges that gap using a novel deep learning architecture and the theory of Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs) to map spike time data to multiple valid neuronal parameter configurations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

1. Create a pipeline to generate degenerate populations of CBMs that reproduce specific neuronal activities.

2. Enable experimental neuroscientists to generate models without deep expertise in machine learning or numerical modeling.

3. Provide a user-friendly open-source software interface to make CBM analysis accessible and practical in lab settings.

## Summary of Research Contributions

**Research Question**

The central research question addressed in this thesis is: "*How can we generate degenerate populations of conductance-based models (CBMs) with a target activity using only recordings of spike times?*" This question is motivated by the need to bridge the gap between experimental data, the reality of experimentalists' work, and computational modeling, facilitating the study of neuronal degeneracy.

**Main Contributions**

This work introduces several key contributions to the field of computational neuroscience:
- **Pipeline Development:** Development of a robust pipeline that combines the theory of Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs) with a deep learning architecture to generate degenerate CBM populations. This pipeline is validated using synthetic data and is adaptable to different CBMs.
- **Iterative Compensation Algorithm:** Improvement of existing methods for generating degenerate populations by introducing an iterative compensation algorithm. This algorithm enhances the precision of targeting specific DIC values with minimal computational overhead.
- **Open-Source Software:** Creation of an open-source software package that provides a user-friendly interface for experimentalists to generate and validate CBM populations. This software does not require expertise in deep learning or programming.
- **Theoretical Insights:** Exploration of reachability in the DICs space, providing a heuristic for selecting conductances to compensate during population generation. This contributes to the theoretical understanding of neuronal activity and degeneracy.

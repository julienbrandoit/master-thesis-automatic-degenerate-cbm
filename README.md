# master-thesis-automatic-degenerate-cbm
Deep learning pipeline for generating degenerate conductance-based neuron models from spike times using Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs). Includes model code, analysis tools, and a user-friendly GUI for experimentalists. Developed as part of my masterâ€™s thesis.
